Features
========

1. **Historical market data collection and pre-processing**

   -  with FX-Manager, you can easily collect historical data from MT4
      history center and preprocess it in just a few lines of code.

2. **Flexibility with historical data formats**

   -  whether the data is OHLCV or bid-ask, whether it's daily or over a
      period of time, all what it takes is a simple configuration and
      the data will be ready to be used in FX-Managers applications.

3. **Open virtual trading account with no limitations**

   -  most forex and stock brokers offer virtual trading accounts for
      new traders to learn trading with no risk of losing money. this
      might be sufficient for manual trading, but when it comes to
      algorithmic trading, it's not practical to use broker's virtual
      accounts to test trading strategies due to their limitations in
      terms of balance and time it takes to open a new account when an
      account is exhausted.

   -  with FX-Manager, there is no need to be constrained with broker's
      limitations, instead of performing actual trading in your broker's
      account each time a trading strategy is tested, FX-Manager creates
      an instance of a virtual account with all properties as an actual
      account and performs trading simulation on this instance without
      affecting the actual account on MT4 trading platform.

   -  user can initialize this instance with any amount of balance and
      any account type with no limitations.

4. **Run real-time trading simulation using real market prices**

   -  using FX-Manager's virtual accounts, you can test your
      user-defined trading strategy by runinig real-time trading
      simulation with real market prices from MT4 live price feed.

   -  this allows you to run multiple simulations in the same time
      because each simulation uses it's own account instance without
      affecting the account connected with MT4. MT4 only acts as a price
      feed source for all running instances.

   -  the simulation shows account state every time period that is
      defined by user.

5. **Run historical trading simulation using historical market prices**

   -  in addition to real-time testing, you can also test your trading
      strategies using historical data and preview results in a very
      nice and well-stractured manner.

6. **Biult-in portfolio construction and optimization**

   -  what currency pairs to invest in and what time frame should be
      used for each currency pair are both the most important questions
      for any forex trader.

   -  with FX-Manager portfolio construction feature. you can construct
      optimized portfolios consisting of diversified collection of
      currency pairs in the best time frame for each pair. these
      portfolios are constructed with historical data and can be used
      for historical and live trading simulations.
